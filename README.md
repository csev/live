This uses FlipClock

I use this to power my site for live events:  http://live.dr-chuck.com/
  
It sets a countdown timer and then refreshes the page dynamically and when the time arrives sends those
watching to a sesignated page.
  
You need to edit the file `setup.php`
  
I have not made the program completely reconfigurable - feel free to send me a PR if you improve it or make it more generic.
